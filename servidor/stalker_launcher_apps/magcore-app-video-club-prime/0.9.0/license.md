Licensor receives customer or user information from various sources, including information from:

* Your requests for Licensor' services;

Licensor uses nonpublic information that it has about You, as described above, to give You superior products and services, provide convenient access to Licensor's products and services, and make a wider range of services available to You.

These companies may receive customer information, but they are restricted in its use and they are required to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws.

If You prefer that Licensor does not disclose Your nonpublic information to non-affiliated third parties, You may opt out of those disclosures, that is, you may direct Licensor not to make those disclosures, other than disclosures as permitted by law, by sending an Email directly to Licensor at sales@infomir.eu.

When Licensor shares nonpublic information with companies working on Licensor's behalf, Licensor insists that such companies use the nonpublic information only to provide the service that Licensor has asked them to perform.  Within Licensor, customer or user information is available only to those individuals who may need to see it to fulfill and service the needs of Licensor's customers or the general function of Licensor. Licensor communicates regarding the need to protect nonpublic information to all employees and agents, especially to those individuals who have access to it.  In addition, Licensor has established and maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to comply with regulations to protect nonpublic information.
