The game starts with 10 cards displayed to the player. After that the cards remain face down. Using the navigation buttons, the player picks up a card and faces it up with the <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/ok.png" class="media" title="ОК" alt="ОК"> button. Now a similar card should be found. If the player finds another card of the same rank and colour, he/she wins the pair and plays again. If not, the cards are turned face down again. The task if to open all the cards as quickly as possible. 
The Memory game stimulates observation, concentration and a good memory.
