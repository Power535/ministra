<p>
A popular number-placement puzzle. A 9×9 grid is divided into nine 3×3 sub-grids (81 squares in total).  The grid already contains some digits. The objective is to fill free squares with digits (from 1 to 9) so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all the nine digits. 
Use the navigation buttons on the remote to move along the grid. To place a digit, press a corresponding button on the remote (digital section). The <img src="pages/es/menu/../images/back_old.png" class="media" title="BACK" alt="BACK" /> or <img src="pages/es/menu/../images/back.png" class="media" title="BACK." alt="BACK." /> button deletes a digit from a square.
