                 Remote Control Keys Configuration Guide.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In file /usr/local/share/app/cfg/keys_definition.json there are definitions for all remote control's keys inluding key name, code, delay and decimation properties in JSON-format.

That describes what will be going when user presses and holds a key button.

For example, the definition of key Rewind in keys_definition.json file looks like:
{
"key": "REWIND",
"code": 918,
"delay": 3,
"decimation": 4
},

which means that when a user presses and holds "Rewind" button on Remote control, the first signal to STB will be transmitted, than next 3 signals will be skipped, 
next signal after that will pass and after that, every fourth signal will be transmitted to STB.

!!! Every signal goes from remote control 114 milliseconds when a button is held. So if you want to change reaction consider this number.

"code" - Do not ever change the value of key "code" - this can cause inappropriate handling of the key press.

"delay"  - Property "delay" defines how many infra-red signals will be skipped while holding key pressed after the first signal.

"decimation" - Property "decimation" defines how many infra-red signals will be skipped while holding key pressed and after "delay".
